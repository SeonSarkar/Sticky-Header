## Setup

The easiest way:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file.
        Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
        
```java
allprojects {
		 repositories {
			  ...
			  maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		 }
	}
  
  ``` 
  Step 2. 
    Add the dependency
    
    ```java
   
   dependencies {
      implementation 'com.github.SeonSarkar:Sticky-Header:1.0.1-alpha'
      }
      
   ```
You may also add the library as an Android Library to your project. All the library files live in ```library```.

## Sticky Adapter Usages
